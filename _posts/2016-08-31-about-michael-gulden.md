# About Michael Gulden

It all started with an idea to start a cool hiking group and evolved into a full-fledged tour company called Active Oahu LLC.

### About Me

I've been living in Oahu for over 7 years. Originally from Southern California, I love to run, bike and do just about anything active. I'm married with one energetic little red head son. My wife, Becca, is a yoga instructor and teaches many of the Destination yoga sessions offered by Active Oahu.

While I was on the Cross Country team at BYU-Hawaii, I ran tons of trails on the North Shore and East side of the island. Although I wasn't the best runner on the team, I gained an even greater appreciation for all that Oahu has to offer. I still cant say I've done every trail on the island, but I've hiked or ran quite a few of them. There is so much of Oahu to explore, even after living here for over 7 years, there are still plenty of worth-while adventures I still haven't done.

I love sharing the beauty of Oahu with guests and helping them feel at least a bit of the appreciation and awe I get from nature; whether it be while surfing, hiking, kayaking, standup paddleboarding, snorkeling or yoga.
