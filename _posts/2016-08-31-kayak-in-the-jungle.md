# Kayak in a Jungle

For the Kayaking Tour we will start out nestled in a valley between two arms of land that stretch out into the ocean to form a sheltered bay. You will be surrounded by green-clad mountains and a picturesque landscape; ocean, beach, mountains and rain forest. We will paddle up a calm river where you can be immersed in the wonderful landscape. For the more adventurous sort, there are plenty of rope swings all along our route as we paddle up the valley. This lush valley is culturally and historically significant, our guides can tell you all about it.

The whole place has an amazonian like feel to it and you will often see wetland birds in the trees as you paddle by and the occasional school of fish rippling under the water.

* Be sure to wear or bring a swimsuit
* Wear sunscreen

This is a Rain forest Valley and one of the wettest parts of the island, so there is a high probability of rain. We do not cancel tours for rain. Rain just makes the tour more refreshing and adventurous. When else can you say you've Kayaked through a Hawaiian jungle in the rain?
